To understand and implement various algorithms that solve shortest path problems in weighted directed graphs, exploring the logic, algorithms, Python code, results, and inferences for each approach. These shortest path algorithms are critical in fields like network routing, logistics, robotics, and AI for determining the optimal paths based on weights (e.g., time, distance, cost).
To understand and implement traversal schemes on a weighted directed graph. The main goal is to explore Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm and examine their outcomes, particularly for pathfinding in weighted, directed graphs.
The goal is to identify and implement algorithms to obtain a minimum spanning tree (MST) for a given weighted undirected graph. The MST is a subset of edges that connects all vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight, without forming cycles.
